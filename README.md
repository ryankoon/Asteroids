# Asteroids
Inspired by the original Asteroids game. Started development on PhoneGap and transitioned to Android Studio.


The core files for this game can be found in www/assets as .html, .css, and .js files.
Importing my project into Android Studio allowed me to implement features using Java such as keeping the screen on.
